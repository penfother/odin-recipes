        <p>
            Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
            flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, 
            and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, 
            anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), 
            which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
